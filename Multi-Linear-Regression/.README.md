# 📈 Multiple Linear Regression – Fuel Consumption & CO₂ Emissions

This lab extends the previous Simple Linear Regression model by incorporating multiple features to predict CO₂ emissions more accurately. The goal is to demonstrate how using more than one predictor can improve model performance.

## 🔍 Feature Selection

Unlike the simple model which used only `FUELCONSUMPTION_COMB`, this version uses two features:

- `ENGINESIZE`
- `CYLINDERS`

These were selected based on their strong positive correlation with `CO2EMISSIONS`, confirmed through visualizations and correlation analysis.

## 📊 Model Performance Comparison

| Model Type              | MSE       | R² Score |
|-------------------------|-----------|----------|
| Simple Linear Regression | 797.43    | 0.81     |
| Multiple Linear Regression | 466.11    | 0.89     |

The multiple linear regression model significantly outperforms the simple model, reducing error and improving predictive accuracy.
