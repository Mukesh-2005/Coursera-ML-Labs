# 📈 Multiple Linear Regression – Fuel Consumption & CO₂ Emissions

This lab extends the previous Simple Linear Regression model by incorporating multiple features to predict CO₂ emissions more accurately. The goal is to demonstrate how using more than one predictor can improve model performance.

---

## 🔍 Feature Selection

Unlike the simple model which used only `FUELCONSUMPTION_COMB`, this version uses two features:

- `ENGINESIZE`
- `CYLINDERS`

These were selected based on their strong positive correlation with `CO2EMISSIONS`, confirmed through visualizations and correlation analysis.

### Fuel Consumption vs CO₂ Emissions
![Fuel vs Emission](https://github.com/Mukesh-2005/Coursera-ML-Labs/blob/main/Multi-Linear-Regression/charts/Fuelconsumption_comp_mpg.png)  
*Higher MPG → Lower emissions. A clear negative correlation.*

### Engine Size vs CO₂ Emissions
