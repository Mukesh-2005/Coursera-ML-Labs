# 🚗 Simple Linear Regression – Fuel Consumption & CO₂ Emissions

This project is a personalized implementation of the **Simple Linear Regression** lab from the Coursera Machine Learning course. The goal is to predict **CO₂ emissions** of vehicles based on selected features using scikit-learn's linear regression model.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

**Source**: [FuelConsumption.csv – Canada Open Data](http://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/98f1a129-f628-4ce4-b24d-6f16bf24dd64)

The dataset includes specifications and fuel consumption ratings for light-duty vehicles sold in Canada. Key features include:

- `ENGINE SIZE`
- `CYLINDERS`
- `FUEL CONSUMPTION COMBINED (L/100 km)`
- `CO2 EMISSIONS (g/km)` ← Target variable

## 🧠 What I Did

- Explored and cleaned the dataset using **Pandas**
- Selected relevant features for prediction
- Built a **Simple Linear Regression** model using **scikit-learn**
- Trained and tested the model with different train-test splits
- Evaluated performance using:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Visualized predictions and residuals using **Matplotlib**

## 🔍 Key Learnings

- How to implement and interpret simple linear regression
- The impact of feature selection on model accuracy
- How train-test split ratios affect performance
- How to evaluate regression models using standard metrics

## 📁 Files Included

- `notebook.ipynb`: Full implementation with code, comments, and visualizations
- `requirements.txt`: Python packages used
- `FuelConsumption.csv`: Dataset used (or link to source)

## 📌 Next Steps

- Try multiple linear regression with more features
- Explore polynomial regression for non-linear relationships
- Compare performance with other regression models (e.g., Ridge, Lasso)
